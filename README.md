# **Pedestrian Detection Application**
This project designed to identify pedestrians in images and videos using advanced computer vision techniques. The application leverages the power of deep learning models, integrating multiple tools and technologies to deliver accurate and efficient pedestrian detection. It also provides a user-friendly interface .

## **Features**
- *Pedestrian Detection in Images:* Detect pedestrians in static images, displaying bounding boxes around detected individuals. <br>

- *Pedestrian Detection in Videos:* Process video files to identify and track pedestrians frame by frame.<br>

- *Visualization of Results:*  Visualize detection results directly on the interface, with bounding boxes . <br>

- *Robust Performance:* Uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, fine-tuned with custom data for improved pedestrian detection.<br>


## **Technologies Used**

- *Roboflow:*   
  Used to prepare and annotate the pedestrian dataset for training the model.

- *YOLOv8 (Ultralytics):*  
  A state-of-the-art object detection model trained on the pedestrian dataset to achieve high accuracy in detection tasks.<br>

- *Flask:*  
  A lightweight Python framework used to develop the backend of the application.<br>

- *HTML/CSS/JavaScript:*
  For designing the frontend and user interface of the application.<br>

- *OpenCV:*
  A computer vision library used for image and video processing, as well as real-time detection.
